**Describe the bug**
When running full_retirement_age_calculator_app.py and are asked to “Enter the year of birth”, instead of an accurate year, letters are typed.
Ex. Instead of “2021”, you type “Twenty twenty-one”.


**Program**
https://github.com/wtccjava/CSC256PublicChangeDoc
Date: September 29, 2021
Time: 2:28:24 PM


**Component**
full_retirement_age_calculator_app.py


**Error Type**
Coding error, since the code doesn’t accommodate for inputs that aren’t correct numbers


**Severity**
Minor Nuisance


**Priority**
TBD


**State**
Open


**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1.	Run full_retirement_age_calculator_app.py
2.	After being asked “Enter the year of birth or <enter> to exit” input a string of text (not numbers)
3.	Click enter and see the errors


**Expected behavior**
For this test I expected to type in a year, even if I spell it out in words, “Twenty twenty-one”, and get the same result as if I typed “2021”, however that didn’t happen.
