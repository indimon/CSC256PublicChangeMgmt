**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
•	Yes, earlier I submitted three bug reports (numbered 1 – 3) where I described errors being given to me when I run the code full_retirement_age_calculator_app.py
•	It would be less frustrating if the code were to take notice of inputs that are “incorrect” based on what the questions are asking
•	I am given errors whenever I enter strings of text, spaces or special characters into the number field (Ex. instead of typing 1992, I type “Nineteen ninety-two”, or “19 92”, or “$19”)

**Component**
full_retirement_age_calculator_app.py


**Describe the solution you'd like**
While I know entering strings of text is and incorrect way of answering what year and month I was born in, it would be better for the code to alert me of my incorrect input and loop back to ask me to input the numbers again (correctly this time). The same goes for entering spaces or special characters (which would usually only happen on accident), but in the event it does happen again for other people, it would be better for the code to alert the user about their incorrect input and loop back to ask for another input of the numbers (correctly this time).


**Describe alternatives you've considered**
While this may be more involved, it would be nice if the code were to read those spaces and special characters and immediately delete them from the input, while still reading the integers entered (if there were any) and read those correctly. Another alternative would be for the code to read those strings of text and automatically translate that into integers, although this may take a very long time to code.
