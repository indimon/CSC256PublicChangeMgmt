**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
•	Not so much a problem as clearing up some possible confusion


**Program**
https://github.com/wtccjava/CSC256PublicChangeDoc
Date: September 29, 2021
Time: 2:28:24 PM


**Component**
full_retirement_age_calculator_app.py
full_retirement_calc.py


**Describe the solution you'd like**
Since this calculator is supposed to be telling the user what age (in years and months) they would have to be before they can retire, it would be nice if more information about this was put into the code. Meaning, on the user-end of things, they were actually being told that’s what they are inputting their birth month and year for. Right now, the code tells the user nothing about what the program is doing, so more context would be helpful.


**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I haven’t really considered any other alternatives, just more information would be nice.
